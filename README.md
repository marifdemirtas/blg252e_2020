# blg252e_2020
Codes I wrote for the homeworks of BLG252E - Object Oriented Programming semester of Spring 2020, at ITU.

All folders include an explanatory PDF file detailing the homeworks. First folder includes a [Calico test file](https://calico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), second folder includes a main.cpp file that tests the functions implemented, and the third folder includes a test_files folder with 5 different test cases.

I expanded the third homework (which implements a neural network class with only forward propagation) to another project at .
